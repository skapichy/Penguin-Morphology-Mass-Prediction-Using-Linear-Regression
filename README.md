# Penguin-Morphology-Mass-Prediction-Using-Linear-Regression
This project uses the penguins dataset to predict body mass from bill depth using linear regression. It includes data cleaning, EDA, model building with statsmodels, and diagnostic checks like Q-Q plots and residual analysis. Insights support ecological research and highlight key morphological relationships.
